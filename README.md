## Simple Character/Stash Converter for PD2
This program converts character/stash files between vanilla and PD2, and updates PD2 files so they can be used with the most recent season.

Supports all PD2 characters and vanilla characters from v1.10+, as well as shared/personal stash files from PlugY v11.02+. Built from [dschu012's D2SLib](https://github.com/dschu012/D2SLib) repository.

To use, run D2SLib.exe from within the *src\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1* folder. Character/stash files will be read from the input folder (*src\Resources\D2S\input*) and saved in the output folder (*src\Resources\D2S\output*). I recommend creating shortcuts for each.
