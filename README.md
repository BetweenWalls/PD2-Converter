## Simple Character/Stash Converter for PD2
This program converts character/stash files between vanilla and PD2, and updates PD2 files so they can be used with the most recent season.

Supports all PD2 characters and vanilla characters from v1.10+ (.d2s files), as well as shared/personal stashes from PlugY v11.02+ (.sss and .d2x files). Built from [dschu012's D2SLib](https://github.com/dschu012/D2SLib) repository. Requires .NET framework to run.

### [Download](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/PD2-Converter/archive/main.zip)

To use, run PD2-Converter.exe (in *src\main*). Character/stash files will be read from the input folder (*src\main\input*) and saved in the output folder (*src\main\output*).

If you encounter bugs, let me know on reddit ([u/BetweenWalls](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=BetweenWalls)) or discord (@BetweenWalls#2390), or just submit an issue here.

**Note:** There is currently an issue that prevents vanilla & season 1 files with *Standard of Heroes* from being converted.
