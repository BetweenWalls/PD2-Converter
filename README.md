## Character Converter for PD2
This program converts character files between vanilla and PD2, and updates PD2 character files so they can be used with the most recent season.

Supports all PD2 characters and vanilla characters from v1.10 onward (2003-2021).

Built from [dschu012's D2SLib](https://github.com/dschu012/D2SLib) repository.

To use, run PD2-Converter. Character files will be read from the input folder and saved in the output folder.
