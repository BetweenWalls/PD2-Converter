# Season 6 Patch Files
This includes a dummy D2HD.dll file to overwrite your season 7 or later version of that file, which would normally prevent the game from running at all. The dummy file will also create a popup error, but the game will run. You can delete the dummy file to prevent the error from popping up - season 6 does not use D2HD.dll.
